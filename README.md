ECE 103 Project - High Altitude Balloon Tracking

This repo is a workspace for a class project. There will be code here that we did NOT write, nor claim to have written. This is just for us to have a place to read and comment on code to understand it at a deeper level so we can implement our own solutions.

Please don't sue us.
